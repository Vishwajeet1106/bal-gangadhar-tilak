	<h1>Bal Gangadhar Tilak</h1>
	<h2>Birth</h2>
	<p>Bal Gangadhar Tilak was born on 23 July 1856 in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra. His full name was Lokmanya Sri Bal
		Gangadhar
		Tilak. His father Gangadhar Tilak was a teacher at school and a Sanskrit scholar and mother was a homemaker at
		home.</p>

	<h2>Education</h2>
	<p>The ancestral village of Bal Gangadhar Tilak was Chikhali. His father, Gangadhar Tilak was a school teacher and
		Sanskrit
		scholar when Tilak was sixteen years old. Tilak was married to Tabibai in 1871. After marriage, she was renamed
		Satyabhamabai. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics in 1877 from Deccan College, Pune. He left
		his
		studies midway to join the LLB course and in 1879 received his LLB degree from Government Law College. After
		graduation,
		Tilak started teaching mathematics at a private school in Pune. Later, due to ideological differences with
		colleagues at
		the new school, he retreated and became a journalist.</p>

	<h2>Career</h2>
	<p>As soon as the symptoms of the plague appeared in Poona, he started the 'Hindu Plague Hospital' and worked for
		several days to raise funds for it. Bal Gangadhar Tilak gave the slogan "Swaraj is our birthright". In 1885 AD
		The "Ferguson College" was established under the aegis of the "Deccan Education Society". He founded the New
		English School for Secondary Education in 1880 with some of his college friends, including Gopal Ganesh Agarkar,
		Mahadev Ballal Namjoshi and Vishnushree Chiplunkar. The Deccan Education Society that Tilak founded with others
		in the 1880s still runs institutions similar to the Ferguson College in Pune.
	<p>

	<p>In 1884, Deccan Education Society was established to create a new system of education. Tilak was associated with
		the "Shivaji Commemoration Movement" in 1895. Prof. Witney of America wrote an article in the Journal of the
		American Oriental Society shortly before his death in 1894, praising Tilak's principles. Had. Lokmanya Tilak
		wrote an article titled "Desfort of the Country" in his letter Kesari in which he opposed the policies of the
		British Government. He was arrested on 27 July 1897 on charges of treason under Section 124-A of the Indian
		Penal Code. He was imprisoned in Mandalay (Burma) jail under rigorous imprisonment of 6 years. Bal Gangadhar
		Tilak established the Home Rule League with the help of Annie Besant.
	<p>

	<p>Bal Gangadhar Tilak gained a lot of fame during the Home Rule Movement, which earned him the title of
		"Lokmanya". In April 1916, he founded the Home Rule League. The main objective of this movement was to establish
		Swaraj in India. Lokmanya Tilak wrote many books like this, but the Gita-secret written in Mandalay jail is the
		best for the interpretation of Srimadbhavadgita which has been translated into many languages.</p>
